# Introducing the Parayil Metric for obtaining Performance-Complexity graphs of machine learning models


A Performance-Complexity (PC) graph, or a Time-Complexity graph, depicts the relationship between the performance of an algorithm to the complexity of the task or environment. In computational sciences, these are very common and powerful for algorithm analysis, comparison and optimization.

<br>However, in the context of machine learning, such PC graphs depicting algorithm performance on learning a task over differing environment/task complexities are mostly absent, even though they would be highly valuable in the analysis of machine learning algorithms. The reason for this is due to the infeasibility of obtaining singular metrics for both machine learning model performance and environment complexity.
<br>In this research project, I overcome these fundamental challenges by inventing a novel mathematical method, involving what I have named the Parayil Metric. I am applying this method in the comparative analysis of the RL models Q-Learning and Deep Q-Learning for their PC graphs.
