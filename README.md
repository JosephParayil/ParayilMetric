# ParayilMetric
Introducing the Parayil Metric for obtaining Performance-Complexity graphs of machine learning models.

A Performance-Complexity graph, or a Time-Complexity graph, depicts the relationship between the performance of an algorithm to the complexity of the task or environment.
In computational sciences, such graphs are very common and powerful for algorithm analysis, comparison and optimization.
However, in the context of machine learning,
